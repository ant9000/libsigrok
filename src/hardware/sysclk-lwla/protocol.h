 *
 * Experimentation has shown that reading chunks larger than about 1024 bytes
 * is unreliable.  The threshold seems to relate to the buffer size on the FX2
 * USB chip:  The configured endpoint buffer size is 512, and with double or
 * triple buffering enabled a multiple of 512 bytes can be kept in fly.

 * The vendor software limits reads to 120 words (15 slices, 540 bytes) at

 * 1008 bytes), thus making the most of two 512 byte buffers.
